# Quality control
## Quality control of questionnaire data from MoBa
The quality control of data from MoBa is based on variable specific rules. Some rules consist only of an upper limit and a lower limit. Others also include dependence to other variables.
All questionnaires registered with values below or above the given limits or meeting a dependence rule are checked in the following way: A data program shows the scanned picture of the page with the suspicious value together with the registered value. The registered value will be compared to what is seen in the picture of the original questionnaire. Where there are discrepancies the registered value will be corrected, but if the values are the same, the value is left unchanged, even if illogical compared to other answers in the questionnaire or biologically implausible.

The following documents show the limits and rules for quality control for the variables in each questionnaire:
