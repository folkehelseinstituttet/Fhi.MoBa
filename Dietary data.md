# Dietary data

#### Important considerations when working with data from food frequency questionnaires**

Food frequency questionnaires are relatively crude instruments asking respondents to recall and report the average intake of various food and drink items during a defined time. The ability and willingness to respond accurately to these questions differ between respondents. Both overreporting and underreporting will occur.  

MoBa does not exclude any reports based on quality of reporting before delivering data from food frequency questionnaires to research projects. Each research project is required to consider criteria for inclusion/exclusion of reports. The most common approach, and suggested cut-off values, are discussed in the section below.

### Assessment of cut-off values 
As most nutrients correlate strongly with total energy intake, the most common approach for excluding individuals with improbable dietary reports is to use cut-off values for biological plausibility of the calculated energy intake.  

A lower limit of 500 kcal/day (2.1 MJ/day) and an upper limit of 3500 kcal/day (14.6 MJ/day) have been applied as cut-off values in large cohort studies in adults. Lower and upper cut-off values for improbable energy-intakes in pregnant women in MoBa has been set to 4.5 MJ/day (1075 kcal/day) and 20 MJ/day (4780 kcal/day), respectively. These cut-offs have been described in _Meltzer et al. 2008_ [1]. Applying these cut-off values will remove the most extreme misreports, but there will still be misreporting within the remaining participants. These are, however, only suggestions, and each research project needs to consider which cut-off values to use. A food frequency questionnaire is better suited for ranking participants according to high and low intakes than for precise estimation. 

### Important papers
The MoBa food frequency questionnaire for assessing diet during pregnancy was developed specifically for pregnant women in MoBa and has been extensively validated. Researchers using dietary data from questionnaire 2 is encouraged to read and cite (if relevant) at least one of papers from the validation study (2-6).

 ## Nutrient intakes calculated from dietary supplements

## Caffeine calculation from food 
Caffeine is present not only in beverages, but also in foods containing cocoa. Total caffeine intake is calculated from the comprehensive food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) answered in gestational week 22 (Questionnaire 2). The FFQ asks about intake of 255 food and beverage items and is a semiquantitative FFQ designed to record dietary habits during the first 4–5 months of gestation. 

1. The calculated caffeine variables comprise of total caffeine intake (mg/day) and caffeine intake (mg/day) from 12 defined groups:  
2. Sandwich spread containing cocoa  
3. Milk containing cocoa  
4. Caffeinated soft drink, artificial sweetened 
5. Caffeinated soft drink, sugar sweetened (cola- and energy drink) 
6. Coffee (filtered, percolated/pressed, powdered instant and espresso) 
7. Decaffeinated coffee 
8. Black tea 
9. Dessert containing cocoa 
10. Cake containing cocoa 
11. Chocolate 
12. Sweets containing cocoa 
13. Cappuccino and cafe latte (coffee with milk) 

The intake of single nutrients and substances calculated from the FFQ correlates with total energy intake. For caffeine from food, this is particularly relevant for the variable reflecting caffeine from cola- and energy drink. In any analysis using this variable as the exposure, total energy intake should be considered to avoid confounding by energy from sugar. Mutual adjustment is another issue to consider when using the contribution from separate groups as exposure variables. 

#### Description of the caffeine calculation 
Average, daily caffeine intake is calculated as the aggregated intake (mg/day) from caffeine sources in the FFQ. In total, there are 17 food items in the FFQ defined as caffeine sources in the calculations (See Table 1). Information about caffeine concentrations in coffee, tea and cocoa was obtained from published reports, and the average concentration from multiple analyses was used. For more details and overview of the concentration values see Sengpiel et al. 2013 (1). Other publications using the calculated caffeine intake include Tollånes et al. 2016 (2), Papadopoulou et al. 2018 (3) and Modzelewska et al. 2019 (4).  

These papers also include intake estimates at different points in time. Caffeine intake from coffee, tea and caffeinated soft drinks (not total intake) from before pregnancy and in early pregnancy can be calculated from the baseline MoBa questionnaire (question 105 in Questionnaire 1E) and intake in late pregnancy can be calculated from the third questionnaire (question 113 in Questionnaire 3E).  
MoBa recommend referring to Sengpiel et al. (1) when describing the caffeine variables. If there are questions related to the caffeine variables, contact Anne Lise Brantsæter (annelise.brantsaeter@fhi.no) or MorBarnData@fhi.no. 

Some dietary supplements contain caffeine. The amount of caffeine contributed from supplements has been calculated for FFQ (Questionnaire 2), where women were asked to report supplement use by name and brand. A database of all reported supplements was established and used. See Haugen et al. 2008 for more details (5). The variable with caffeine intake from supplements is named s_koffein_v9. Note that the caffeine intake from supplements is calculated for an older version of the MoBa data files (version 9).

# Dietary questionnaire to youths (Q-youth diet) 
## Nutrient intakes calculatied from food
### Assessment of cut-off values 
As most nutrients correlate strongly with total energy intake, the most common approach for excluding individuals with improbable dietary reports is to use cut-off values for biological plausibility of the calculated energy intake.  

A lower limit of 500 kcal/day (2.1 MJ/day) and an upper limit of 3500 kcal/day (14.6 MJ/day) have been applied as cut-off values in large cohort studies in adults. Lower and upper cut-off values for improbable energy-intakes in pregnant women in MoBa has been set to 4.5 MJ/day (1075 kcal/day) and 20 MJ/day (4780 kcal/day), respectively. Applying these cut-off values will remove the most extreme misreports, but there will still be misreporting within the remaining participants. A food frequency questionnaire is better suited for ranking participants according to high and low intakes than for precise estimation. 

The questionnaire for youths in MoBa is less comprehensive than the questionnaire for pregnant women in MoBa and include fewer questions. Suggested lower cut-off value is 3.0 MJ/day (700 kcal) for both boys and girls. Suggested upper cut-off values is 14.6 MJ/day (3500 kcal) for girls and 18 MJ (4300 kcal) for boys. This would exclude around 3-5% of the study population, where more are excluded in the upper end of the distribution than in the lower end. These are, however, only suggestions and each research project needs to consider which cut-off values to use and whether to differentiate the cut-off values for boys and girls.
