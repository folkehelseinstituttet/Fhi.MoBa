# Dietary data

**Important considerations when working with data from food frequency questionnaires**

## Dietary questionnaire in pregancy (Q2) - calculations from food

### Background 
Food frequency questionnaires are relatively crude instruments asking respondents to recall and report the average intake of various food and drink items during a defined time. The ability and willingness to respond accurately to these questions differ between respondents. Both overreporting and underreporting will occur.  

MoBa does not exclude any reports based on quality of reporting before delivering data from food frequency questionnaires to research projects. Each research project is required to consider criteria for inclusion/exclusion of reports. The most common approach, and suggested cut-off values, are discussed in the section below.  

### Assessment of cut-off values 
As most nutrients correlate strongly with total energy intake, the most common approach for excluding individuals with improbable dietary reports is to use cut-off values for biological plausibility of the calculated energy intake.  

A lower limit of 500 kcal/day (2.1 MJ/day) and an upper limit of 3500 kcal/day (14.6 MJ/day) have been applied as cut-off values in large cohort studies in adults. Lower and upper cut-off values for improbable energy-intakes in pregnant women in MoBa has been set to 4.5 MJ/day (1075 kcal/day) and 20 MJ/day (4780 kcal/day), respectively. These cut-offs have been described in _Meltzer et al. 2008_ [1]. Applying these cut-off values will remove the most extreme misreports, but there will still be misreporting within the remaining participants. These are, however, only suggestions, and each research project needs to consider which cut-off values to use. A food frequency questionnaire is better suited for ranking participants according to high and low intakes than for precise estimation. 

### Important papers
The MoBa food frequency questionnaire for assessing diet during pregnancy was developed specifically for pregnant women in MoBa and has been extensively validated. Researchers using dietary data from questionnaire 2 is encouraged to read and cite (if relevant) at least one of papers from the validation study (2-6).
