# Coding of medication (ATC-codes)

## Coding of medications from open ended text fields

All given medications in the questionnaires are coded using ATC coding system (the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system).
Data (code) is stored in variables named with a suffix K (for coded). The names correspond to the name for variables with the belonging open ended text field. There is a hyphen after each ATC-code. Where there is more than one given medication in a specific field, the ATC-codes are separated by hyphens.
The procedure for coding of medications in MoBa (only available in Norwegian) are described in: [Koderutiner.pdf](PDF/CodingMoBa/Koderutiner.pdf) 

** Example:** <br>
Variable AA1627_K contains coded data for medications given in question 39.18 in 
questionnaire 1 with label desription _(AA1627_K: S_3918_3_K:Questionnaire 1C; (S_3918_3_K:Questonnaire1B); 
(S_4023_3_K:Questionnaire 1A); Anemia/low haemoglobin, Name of medicine; 3. Do you 
have or have you had any of the following illnesses or health problems? If you have taken 
medication (tablets, mixtures, supporsitories, inhelers, creams etc.) in conjunction with the 
illness or health problem give the name(s) of the medication(s) and when you took them)._ 

The contents of this variable can for example be “B03BB01-E000009-“, 
meaning the women has specified a medicine with ATC-code “B03BB01” and an iron 
supplement (see the list below). <br>
