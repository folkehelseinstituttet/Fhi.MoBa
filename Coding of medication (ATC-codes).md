# Coding of medication (ATC-codes)

## Coding of medications from open ended text fields

All given medications in the questionnaires are coded using ATC coding system (the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system).
Data (code) is stored in variables named with a suffix K (for coded). The names correspond to the name for variables with the belonging open ended text field. There is a hyphen after each ATC-code. Where there is more than one given medication in a specific field, the ATC-codes are separated by hyphens.
The procedure for coding of medications in MoBa (only available in Norwegian) are described in : [Koderutiner.pdf](PDF/CodingMoBa/Koderutiner.pdf)
