## Welcome to MoBa Wiki, 

**a web page that includes all documentation needed for analyzing data from MoBa.** 

### MoBa research data files 

* Version 12 was made available to researchers in January 2019. 

* Version 11 was made available to researchers in August 2018. 

* Version 10 of the MoBa-data file was made available to researchers in July 2017. In version 10, all participant forms up until the 8 years questionnaire are complete.

### Would you like to contribute with syntax to MoBa's syntax library? 

MoBa Wiki includes a syntax library for variables that may be helpful when analyzing data from MoBa. The aim is to build a more extensive syntax library covering different types of variables based on data from all MoBa questionnaires. 

Please contact [MorBarnData@fhi.no](MorBarnData@fhi.no) if you have syntax on how to generate variables based on data from MoBa that you think might be helpful to other research projects. Please use the [template](https://mobawiki.fhi.no/mobawiki/index.php/Template) when sending syntax to MoBa. 

**All syntax published on the MoBa Wiki page is checked by MoBa, but MoBa is not responsible for any errors in the study results that are caused by errors in syntax.**
