## Welcome to MoBa Wiki

**a web page that includes all documentation needed for analyzing data from MoBa.** 

### MoBa research data files 

An overview of MoBa-data files available to researchers can be viewed [here](https://www.fhi.no/en/ch/studies/moba/for-forskere-artikler/moba-research-data-files/) 

## Genetic data in MoBa
Information about genetic data in MoBa can be viewed here. More information about the dataset, which files are available and how the quality control was performed, is available on the [MoBa Genetics Github site](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/mobagen). 

### Would you like to contribute with syntax to MoBa's syntax library? 

MoBa Wiki includes a syntax library for variables that may be helpful when analyzing data from MoBa. The aim is to build a more extensive syntax library covering different types of variables based on data from all MoBa questionnaires. 

Please contact [MorBarnData@fhi.no](mailto:MorBarnData@fhi.no) if you have syntax on how to generate variables based on data from MoBa that you think might be helpful to other research projects. 

**All syntax published on the MoBa Wiki page is checked by MoBa, but MoBa is not responsible for any errors in the study results that are caused by errors in syntax.**
